## Overview
This project explores building a **lightweight edge platform**
on a constrained Raspberry Pi 3, applying real-world
platform engineering and SRE principles.

## Goals
- Design a production-inspired edge architecture
- Operate under strict hardware constraints
- Provide ingress, observability, and operational tooling
- Document decisions, trade-offs, and learnings

## Hardware & Constraints
- Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (1GB RAM)
- Debian GNU/Linux 12
- ARM64 architecture
- SD card storage

## Architecture
*(Diagram coming soon)*

## Platform Components
*(Ingress, Observability, Management)*

## Observability
*(Metrics, dashboards, alerting philosophy)*

## Operational Learnings
*(Failures, limits, tuning, improvements)*

## Source Code
*(GitHub link will be added)*
