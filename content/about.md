I’m **Indunil Sandaruwan Thembuwana**, a Senior Manager in Service Operations
with deep experience in middleware platforms, reliability engineering,
and large-scale enterprise systems.

Indushomelab is my personal technology lab where I:
- Experiment with platform and edge architectures
- Apply SRE and observability principles
- Document real-world trade-offs and lessons
- Build portfolio-grade engineering projects

Everything here is built on **real hardware**, under **real constraints**.
